  h1 Brandon and Ginger's Baby Shower
  p Brandon and Ginger have already inherited many items from family and friends with slightly older children, and do not need much for the baby at this point.  However, they also know and appreciate how much you all want to help get them started on the best footing as parents!

  p They ask that, for gifting, you please do one of the following:
  ol
    li only purchase gifts that are on their registry,
    li contribute to a larger item, or
    li assist them in one of various ways as a gift.  More info on each below.

  p 1)  Brandon and Ginger’s gift registries can be found at these links: <br>
   a(href='http://www.amazon.com/registry/baby/NBTA6UARRTDK' title='amazon registry link') Our Amazon Registry <br>
   a(href='http://www.target.com' title='target registry link') Our Target or Container Store Registry

  p 2)  Here are a few higher-ticket items that they would love to have and are planning to invest in themselves if/as needed.  Please talk to Sharon or Linda about contributing.

    li Rocking chair
    li College fund for the baby

  p 3)  Ginger and Brandon would very much appreciate any support for early parenthood, such as in the following ways:
  ul
    li A homemade meal, to be enjoyed with you at their home (so you can also meet the baby!).  We will have a sign-up sheet for this at the baby shower.
    li Gift card for Back to Basics Kitchen.  These folks catered Brandon and Ginger’s wedding, and now make high-quality prepared foods that can be bought and warmed at home.  backtobasicskitchen.com
    li Subscription food services - if you’d like to contribute to one of these, please let Linda or Sharon know, and we will happily coordinate it so they don’t get multiple of something all at once.  :-D
    ul
      li BlueApron.com
      li LoveWithFood.com (they give a meal to a hungry child with every box sent, and they have a gluten-free box!)
    li Time from a house-cleaning service
    li Other body- and/or soul-nourishing activities you can think of for the new parents or the whole family!
